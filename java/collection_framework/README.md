This collection is a subset of java.util that is useful for solving algorithm problems on Codeforces and other sites.

The included file was generated by excluding the following types of Classes from java.util package:
* Legacy implementations, like Vector and Stack and Enumeration
* Concurrency Framework
* DuplicateFormatFlagsException.html and other exceptions
* FormattableFlags.html and other flags
* GregorianCalendar, Timer, TimeZone etc
* Currency
* Locale
* Repetitive classes: OptionalInt/OptionalLong etc
* UUID
* All Functions, including Consumer and Supplier
* Jar
* Regex
* Spi
* Streams
* Zip
* StringBuilder (included in the String directory instead)
* Some other classes, possibly?


Classes I would like to remove:
* Abstract{Collection, List, Map etc} - they should be the same as the corresponding interface, but AbstractList introduces the removeRange method. Let me know what you think.
